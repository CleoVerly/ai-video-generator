The workers, helpful to the readers, including: that the Great Qur’an is not like any other books in arrangement and tabs, because it has reached the end of rhetoric, and in the good purpose, and in the wonderful style, and the strange effect is what is the biggest evidence that it is the word of God, and it is downloaded from Hakim Hamid, so you find it in one verse that combines the means and purposes, between the evidence and the significance, and between the sciences, and between the science And the branches, between religious, worldly and eschatological sciences, and between multiple purposes and beneficial purposes, and restores the beneficial meanings of the servants, to be taught, complement their guidance, and their paths on the straight path, knowing and working. Page: 3 unknown, so standing on the interpretation of some of the Qur’an appoints the greatest aid to know the rest of it, and God made him a idiot, in which the beneficial sciences, and the full great meanings, and this is from the Almighty’s facilitation of his book.

Restrictions: His guidance is being guided by the guidance of the righteous believers; For people who understand, think, and for those who intended the truth, and this is a statement of God Almighty for the condition of his guidance; It is that the shop must be capable and factor, so it must be guided by reason, thinking and managing its verses; The exhibition, which does not think and does not manage its verses, does not benefit from it, and whoever does not mean the truth and has no purpose in the guidance, but rather his intention is corrupt, and he has set himself on his resistance and opposition, has no share of his guidance; The first prohibited his guidance for losing the condition, and the second is to the existence of the barrier; As for those who come to him, and think about his meanings and manage them with good understanding, good intent, and peace from passion, he guides him to every required, and he obtains every great and desirable goal.

The varied. He described it as a cure for what is in the breasts, and this includes all heart diseases; It explains the diseases of the hearts and diagnoses them, and guides the servants to every means that its disappearance and healing gets, so he reminds them of the diseases of ignorance, doubts, confusion and reasons for that, and guides them to their extraction with useful sciences",

For these and other reasons we saw that the interest calls for limiting the summary of that interpretation; We hope that the Lord will be blessed, and that the intended will be obtained; We saw that the best is to mention each topic in its severity, because of its approximation, ease and collecting meanings that are from one art in one place; Although - as it was mentioned - many branches must be included in the verses of the origins, and in the verses of the branches many of the origins, and in them enters out of intimidation, intimidation and stories a lot; This strange mixture of the perfection of the Qur’an and the greatness of its influence, it is a book of teaching that removes various ignorances, and the book of education is based on morals and deeds, as it teaches, rises, polite and disciplines the highest of the ways, which the wise and the wise cannot suggest like it, nor what is nearly.

Equity is in the face, because they tell themselves, and their words are likely to be the one in their hearts, and it is possible that they say what they do not think, and on both matters, the truth must be accepted, whether it is the virtuous or the preferred, the truth is higher than everything.

His life and pension; That is why the good management in the pension was one of the most important indications of the mind of its owner, so whoever transcends the beneficial phase to the harmful process of extravagance, there is no doubt that this is because of the lack of his mind, it is evidenced by the lack of reason with the bad management. He returned his body something that he used to, and if he returns him a lot of eating or eating various foods, it may be impossible in some cases to the poverty of the page: 322 unknown or others, and then the body loses what was used to him, then his health is deviated.

I saw the heart that is inclined to sins, rapidly led to it, as it is sick, it is quick to fascinate when there are the causes of sedition, as the Almighty said:﴿ So the one who is in his heart is satisfied with a disease. For his original cruelty or perverted beliefs that he believed and established his heart on it, and it is difficult for him to lead to the truth if he violates it, and the two things may meet, and as for the rans, the place and the covers that are on the hearts, it is one of the effects of the servant's earning and crimes, so if he is offered from the truth and opposes the truth, and the truth came to him, and God opened the gates of adulthood, and closed it from himself that God punished him for this. Facilitated, and he arrogated her and returned it, so he printed on his heart and sealed him, surrounded him with crimes and sins were covered on him and his heart was covered, and he made between him and the truth a veil and closed the heart, for these meanings that God most mentioned in his book, if you knew these controls mentioned in this benefit, it became clear to you its meanings, and I knew that the wisdom of God and his justice in this For themselves and their satisfaction with her. It is the worship in his saying: “And they praise him with a deception and originality” [Al -Fath: 9] and the right concerned with the Messenger, which is reverence and condolence, and the common truth, which is faith in God and His Messenger.

It is very important to the sun, moon and planets, and sunset: If you are ignorant, he said: The example of his saying: Page: 334 is unknown﴿ even when he reached the west of the sun and found it, it is strange in the eyes of the sun. 86] That is, in the sea with the vision of the eye, and his saying:﴿ And they found it as a people who did not make them without them without it.

And from that he left what souls have from immorality, with the strength of the one who calls for the proof of faith, trust and sincerity. One of the reasons for the doubling is that the work in it is a benefit for Muslims and singing, such as jihad for the sake of God, jihad with argument and proof, and the sofa, This category:﴿ The example of those who spend their money in the path of God as the same as a love that has gone seven Sanabb in every Sinbula, a pardon And God is wide, knowledge",

And he brought him to his pleasure, and the story of the prostitute that gave the dog that almost died from thirst, witnessing this. From that, the height of the worker with God and his grace, as God Almighty said: “O women of the Prophet, he will not be like one of the women.” ﴿ Whoever is certain of God and His Messenger and doing righteousness, its reward is two times for two times. With the worship of God, and in the hadith: “You have no prayers except what you have been reasonable for.” Prayer, reading, remembrance and other acts of worship if it is with the power of the presence of a heart and a complete faith is therefore there is no doubt that between them and the worship of the heavier are degrees that are interrupted without the necks of the rubber. And the love of good for Muslims with glow with a remembrance of a force that is not attached to any of the works, and its people are preceded by every virtue, reward and reward, and the rest of the works followed them, so the people of sincerity, charity and remembrance are the former former those close to the gardens of bliss. Page: 338 Anonymous * Benefit: God has commanded in his book to think, reflect, consider and see, and other methods in which the sciences obtain, praised its people, and he told that his book was revealed to this ruling, and praised the knowledge and certainty and praise of their families, and the approach of all the way to it. And the third: the path of reason, and the limit is that the information is either realized with the sense of hearing, sight, touch or taste, or you realize the mind, or that you get news, and each of these three may compare the other, especially the mind and sincere news, they do not separate. Knowledge of these matters is varying ranks. To every mental and transferred mental evidence? And in the news of God and the news of his messengers from the great statement and details of all the races of beneficial sciences what the sciences of all creatures do not reach, the first and the last of them. And sensory? Look at the unification of God, the necessity of his uniqueness and individualism in oneness, and unite it with the qualities of perfection, how were the heavenly books charged with them? Rather, it is the greatest intended of it, especially the Qur’an that is",
    "From the beginning to the end of it, this origin, which is the largest and greatest origin, decides. How did all the Apostles agree from the beginning to the end, especially their imam and their seal Muhammad ﷺ on the determination of the unification of God and its uniqueness in oneness, the capacity of the attributes and its greatness: from the capacity of knowledge and wisdom, the general ability and will, the comprehensiveness of praise, the king, the glory, the majesty, the beauty, the good, the charity in its names and goodness? Then look at this great origin in the hearts of the masters of creation, the first full hearts and minds, how do you find it greater than everything, stronger and greater than everything, and clearer than everything, and that they are presented to them all the facts, and that they teach him a necessary intuitive science before theoretical evidence, and they know that everything he opposed is the invalidity of falsehood? Then look at the large number of proofs transferred, reasonable, and perceived, witnessing God in oneness. In everything he has a verse ... indicates that it is one of all things in the upper and lower world and their survival and what they are of various descriptions, all of this is evidence and evidence of the presence of its creator and its stomach and its stretching with everything you need, and whoever denies this has been faded and exaggerated and denied the most evacuated things. Page: 340 unknown, and here you know that atheist materialists misled the creation, the most ignorant, and the greatest of them as vanity and ecstaar, where they were deceived when they stood on some of the naturally materially materially materially physical universe sciences, and their minor minds stood up with them, and they seized them confusion and enlarged with their distant knowledge and said: We prove what our knowledge has reached and deny what else, so you know this that this is ignorant With the agreement of the wise, whoever denies what he does not know has demonstrated his lie and slander, just as whoever proves something without knowledge is lost, so whoever denies something without knowledge, and also knows that their proof of the sciences of nature that they knew and ended with their acquaintances is that this evidence from them is a minor who did not reach its goal and its truth And its causes; Rather, they apparently knew about them and they are unaware of the benefactor, so they prove some reason and blinded the intended, and they are in their knowledge that they are confused, and they do not prove to them a matter of things, and do not prove to them a correct and straight theory, they are always in confusion, confusion and contradiction, and whenever the right proofs come to them, their saying is invalidated. And the Almighty said to them: “Rather, they lied to the truth when they came to them, so they were in a matter of marginal” [Q: 5] With what they were mocked by them [Ghafir: 83] What is meant is that this great origin has indicated all the evidence with its races and types, and the arbitrary Sharia and the generalized general destiny was indicated by it, and only these misguidance in which their mug was brought down in it, and they were given their consideration. The message, and that God has established the sincerity of his messengers from the verses that is what he believes in human beings, especially Muhammad ﷺ, the verses of his prophethood and the evidence of his message and his sincerity are varied: his biography and morals and what he brought from the right religion, and urged him to create a generous creation, good deeds, benefit, charity, and justice, and forbid it against that, and what he brought from the revelation: the book and the Sunnah, all of which are the sentence and detail with its prophecy God honored him from the great victory and showing his religion on all religions, and from answering invitations and the solutions of types of blessings that are not their types as well",
    "About its members, and this is due to the testimony of previous books, and the inability of those opposed to it in all the challenges, and their inability to void their void. The falsehood is still in the hands of what the Messenger brought in a delicate delicate, so that those in charge of what the Messenger who is in charge of his religion unites all the people of the earth to bring goodness, peasant or real sophistication or real happiness in all its faces What the Messenger brought and guided to him and denied the creation on it, and had it not been for ignorance of what the Messenger brought, and severe intolerance of enemies and violent resistances, and the establishment of multiple violent barriers to prevent the masses and the fat from seeing the explicit truth and the right religion, there is no religion left on the face of the religion of Muhammad ﷺ to call and guide it and urge it to all goodness, reform, goodness and rationality, but the resistance of the enemies The forgery and the retirement of the people of religion from doing it and supported by the page: 342 unknown is the one that prevented the most creation from standing on its reality. Then I look at the third origin, which is to prove the hostile and the reward. And how much God has established it from the transfer and mental evidence, as well as the sensual viewing indicates the greatest indication of it, and how much I bear witness to this house as a model of reward and punishment, and I see them solutions to the likes of the lies, and the types of worldly penalties for criminals, as I see them as the escape of the Apostles and those who followed them from the believers, and their honor in the world before the hereafter, and how much God has invalidated every suspicion of the liars of the lies Satisfying the similarities directed to those who are lied to his unification and the truth of his messengers, and between their foolishness and the corruption of their minds, and that they have no documents to deny that except abstract exclusion, and measure the ability of the Lord of the Worlds to the destiny of the creatures. The origins of the various proofs, in this evidence that everyone who has proven a known or a fact of the facts in a mental, news, or sensory way, then denied one of these three origins that are the basis of religion, he has become his mind, his sense and his knowledge, and he called for himself with the great contradiction; Because the methods that he indicated to prove his information are - and twice them and twice as much, and what is stronger than them and clearer - has indicated monotheism, mission and hostility. Know that the information is with the news of God and the news of his messengers in general in which news enters page: 343 unknown from God and his angels and all the unseen, and matters of Sharia and destiny, which is the infallible news that knows the lie of what he violated and invalidated, I know. For the severity of their care, the perfection of their sincerity, the strength of their religion, and that they in particular have kept from the public error, and the agreement on the right. One of the things that is known is that the correct minds that did not change their instinct, and did not spoil the corrupt beliefs, know a certain knowledge of good monotheism and sincerity to God, as you know the ugliness of polytheism, and learned good honesty, justice and charity to the creatures, as you know Al -Munayem, and the obligation of parents",
    "The link of relatives, and the right of those who have the right to you, and it is good for all goodness and reform, and it will be used for all corruption and harm, and from the most honorable of what he knows about the mind that he is concentrated in the minds that the absolute perfection of God alone, and that he has complete wisdom in his creation and his law, and that it is not appropriate for him to leave his creation in vain that they do not command or end, and they do not reward and do not punish, And the vision of notables is the one who has completed knowledge, it is not the news as the inspection, and what realizes with the sense of what is realized by smelling good smells and malicious smells, and what is realized by touching like heat and cold, and what he realizes by analyzing things and standing on their materials, jewels and attributes, all of this is from the perceptions of sense, and in the whole page: 344 unknown, the methods of science to the information are very many, and the greater the thing and the most important knowledge is more important to it. The most correct and stronger, as the reference was presented to monotheism, the message and the hostile, and God knows best. And say, Glory be to Him, who was harnessed for us, and what we have for him - and we are to our Lord for the sake And submit to God, and use it for his worship; Because what is meant by his saying:﴿ And to our Lord for the conglomerate ﴾[Al -Zukhruf: 14] recognition of reward and preparation for him, and that what is meant by these blessings is to be a help to the servant for what he created from obedience to God, and in his saying: “Then you remember the grace of your Lord. Ali [Al -Zukhruf: 13] Restricting it in this case at the time of the grace. Because a lot of creation is removed from the blessings, and they omitted them from God, and the evil and the patterns are required for them, for this state in which God commanded is the medicine of this deadly disease, because when the servant is mentioned that he is immersed in the blessings of God, and that its origins and facilitation and facilitation of its causes and its survival and the payment of what is contrary to it or lacks all of God's grace and charity is not something from the servant, and he is subjected to God And God blesses it, and it is a real blessing. Page: 345 benefits, but rather great benefits in mentioning something of the reasons that God mentioned in his book connecting to the high demands of the benefit of great benefits in mentioning some of the reasons that God mentioned in his book connecting to the high demands. The varied - especially the great matters - only gets to seek its reasons that are connected to it, as well as the harms do not rush except by seeking the reasons that you pay, and in his book the purpose of showing these reasons, and guided the servants to them, whoever wires them won the required, and escaped from every time.

Patience: imprisoning the soul on the hardships in order to seek the pleasure of God, and it is divided into three sections: patience for obedience to God, especially the hard obedience until he performs it in the face of perfection, and patience for disobeying God, especially the sin that calls the soul to a strong supplication, so that he can fight for God The painful destiny of God, especially if the calamity is great so that it does not be angry, and perhaps the situation has reached the consent of God.

That is why he was the one who has disobedience to God, a worshiper, close to his Lord, and that worship is only done with sincerity: “Sincerity to God alone”: that the servant intends to the face of God, his consent and his reward in his apparent and inner deeds, and he added to the work for hypocrisy and reputation, and for the sake of the display of the world, and the balance of this is the Almighty saying about the choice: And satisfied ﴾[Al -Ma’idah: 2] and his saying ﷺ: “Rather, the deeds are with intentions, but for every person what he intended, so whoever his migration to God and His Messenger, then I migrated to God and His Messenger, and whoever deserted him to a world that afflicts him or a woman who marries her, then I migrated to what he immigrated to him.

And its clarity in it is a great aid to understand the words of the Lord of the worlds, and that the words of God are enough to show everything that the servants benefit in their pension and hostility, and to guide them to everything that contains their various interests and their multiple benefits, and that it is not possible to righteousness and reform for all conditions except with the behavior of the ways that I guide this Qur’an in the origins of religion and its branches, and in morals and ethics, and in the internal and external matters, And Nura, and praise be to God, whose grace is righteous, and may God bless Muhammad and his family and companions and those who followed them with charity until the Day of Judgment. .

    "Cover Milestones of the Prophet’s Sunnah Book: The Milestones of the Prophet’s Sunnah, author: Saleh Ahmed Al -Shami, anonymous, Milestones of the Prophet’s Sunnah, the first volume (1/1). He, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, said in the hadith of Gabriel, peace be upon him - as with Ibn Majah -: (That is Gabriel, I will teach you the features of your religion). This, and I hope God Almighty - as Gabriel's hadith was a statement of the total milestones of religion - that this book be a statement of the detailed features of it. Saleh Ahmad Al -Shami (1/4) anonymous the introduction that praise be to God we praise him, seek help and seek forgiveness, and seek refuge in God from the evils of ourselves and from the bad deeds of our actions, whoever guides God is not misleading to him, and whoever misleads there is no guidance for him. And I bear witness that there is no god but God alone who has no partner, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger. And yet: The most honorable science was related to the Book of God Almighty and the Sunnah of His Messenger, may God bless him and grant him peace, and thank God Almighty to make me happy in this generous welcome. Twenty years ago, I began to work on combining the two Sahihs, and then followed by other books that formed with a \"project to bring the purified Sunnah\". And God Almighty may be pleased with him, with him, his generosity - to direct fourteen books from the honorable Sunnah books within this project, which are the books that scholars presented on others. The day is the fifteenth book, and it is completely this project. (1/5) An unknown, and this book will include between his two books a sufficient summary of the books that preceded it all, and for this he called it \"the worlds of the prophetic Sunnah\" and I hope that every Muslim finds his need, which requires knowledge of him in matters of his religion and worldly. And this book would not have appeared without the efforts that were made in preparing what preceded it. In this introduction, I will talk about two things: The first: Explain the goals of the project, and explain what he presented to his knowledge, as it is originally from this book. The second: talking about this book. This, and may God bless our master Muhammad and his family and companions, and the last of our prayers, I am praise be to God, Lord of the worlds. The surprise of Shaaban 1434 AH - and written by Saleh bin Ahmed Boubis Al -Shami (1/6) an unknown project to bring the purified Sunnah to include this project under its wings fourteen books, which are the origins of the Sunnah, which are: 1 - “Muwatta Imam Malik”. 2 - \"Musnad of Imam Ahmad\". 3 - The \"correct mosque\" of Imam Al -Bukhari. 4 - The \"correct mosque\" by Imam Muslim. 5 - \"The Sunnah of Imam Abi Dawood\". 6 - \"Imam Al -Tirmidhi Mosque\". 7 - \"Sunan Imam Al -Nasa’i\". 8 - \"Sunan Imam Ibn Majah.\" 9 - \"Sunan Al -Darmi\". 10 - \"The Great Sunan\" by Imam Al -Bayhaqi. 11 - Sahih Imam Ibn Khuzaymah. 12 - Sahih Imam Ibn Hibban. (1/7) Anonymous 13 - \"Mustadrak Al -Raki's Imam\". 14 - \"The hadiths chosen\" by Imam Al -Maqdisi. This project was published - in six books: 1 - \"The Mosque between the two Sahihs\". 2 - \"The appendages of the Sunnah on the two Sahihs\". 3 - \"Zawad al -Muwatta\" and",
    "\"Musnad\" on the six books. 4 - \"Al -Sunan Al -Kubra\" of Al -Bayhaqi on the six books. 5 - “Zawad Ibn Khuzaymah”, “Ibn Hibban” and “Al -Mustadrak” on the nine books. 6 - “The Specifications of Hadiths Selected” on the nine books. The main goal of this project is to delete repeated hadiths, so that one conversation is only mentioned once. What is meant by one hadith is what was narrated by one of the Companions and mentioned in the same book, or in these books more than once. The example of this is: The hadith narrated by Umar ibn al -Khattab, may God be pleased with him, which is his saying, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him: 8) An unknown and in such a case, it is sufficient to mention this hadith once under the door that is its subject. This project - after deleting the repeated - is (28430). Time is going. This was not possible before this project existed. Praise be to God. (1/9) Anonymous the place of the books of this project: These books are the most important and greatest books of the Sunnah, and scholars have presented them on others, and they praised their position, and I mention here some of the sayings mentioned in that regarding them in a nutshell: 1 - Imam Al -Nawawi said: 2 - The scholar Al -Kettani said in “The extremist message”: “From it - that is: the books of the hadith - what the student of knowledge should be the beginning of it, which are the mothers of the modern books, their origins and the most famous, which are six:“ Sahih Imam Al -Bukhari ”,“ Sahih Imam Muslim ”,“ Sunan Abi Dawood ”,“ Al -Tirmidhi Mosque ”,“ Sunan Al -Nasa’i ”, and“ Sunan Ibn Majah ”. And Ibn Hajar: If he made the “Musnad Al -Darimi” he was the first. For the scholar Muhammad Abdulaziz Al -Khouli (1310 - 1349).",
    "More than seven hundred and fifty thousand hadiths. It was classified in the science of hadith, like it, in terms of discipline, arrangement and quality. Including: “Sahih Abi Hatim”, Muhammad bin Hibban. Including: \"Sahih Abi Abdullah, the ruler of Nisaburi.\" The scholar Ahmad Shaker - may God have mercy on him - said: “Sahih Ibn Khuzaymah” and “The Sahih Musnad on Daliments and Species” by Ibn Hibban, and “Al -Mustadrak on the Sahih” for the ruler. The chosen horses from what is not in the two Sahihs or one of them, “Dhia al -Din al -Maqdisi. Those are some scholars ’sayings about this collection of books, and they are sayings that indicate the high position they enjoyed among scientists who are able to do this art. And if the \"six books\" are the mothers of modern books and their origins, as Al -Kettani says, and they are the ones that almost leave the hadiths except the easy notes, as Al -Khouli says, so what is the appropriate saying if these fourteen books are met. The greatest thought is that she did not leave a correct hadith, and if that happens, then in the narrated hadiths there is nothing to do, and whoever is allowed to read it, then he has seen the entirety of the Sunnah, but rather most of them. (1/12) Anonymous, the second topic, this book. The goal that this book means is to find a reference for every Muslim - that is, his culture - is due to it to stand on the noble hadiths that explain to him what matters to him in all his affairs, whether religious or worldly. In other words, finding a book that contains the overall Sunnah, so that his reader is familiar with the sayings of the Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, and his actions in every matter that was written by the books of the purified Sunnah. To reach this goal, the following matters were necessary: ​​1 - Collecting the Book Article: We saw how the hadiths of the books \"Fourteen\" had become a group, arranged and deleted, repetitive, after it was (114194) it became (28430). But this gathering came distributed over six books, which are: “The Mosque between the two Sahihs” and the subsequent books of “appendages” whose total number (22) volumes reached. And if the matter becomes easy for a student of knowledge if he wants to search that (1/13) is unknown to him",
    "In these books - with one arrangement - this is not imagined from others, so it was recommended to collect the material of these books in one book. 2 - Choosing the hadiths to be placed in this book: After collecting hadiths from these books, we will find ourselves in front of many hadiths that can be dispensed with due to repetition or others. So a plan was necessary to select on the basis of it. The clarity of the end and the determination of the destination helps to choose, as it helps to shorten time and benefit from time. After looking, I found that the hadiths to be chosen from each section should meet two requirements: The first: to include all the rulings in the section in question. The second: to include all the meanings contained in it as well. As for the way that this can be achieved, it is the opening of these six books - which contained the fourteen books - on the first section, for example, and after studying the hadiths mentioned in this section in the six books, the hadiths that provide the previous two demands are chosen. . Regardless of the lack of these hadiths or their abundance, as it is intended to cover the rulings and meanings in the hadiths of the door. (1/14) Unknown, and by the implementation of these two officers, we can delete many of the repeated hadiths or that match the meaning or converge. Here, some of them might ask: Where did the repetition come from, and the talk has already been talked about deleting it? To answer this question, I say: Repeated hadiths here are other than the hadiths that were previously deleted in the first project. The previously deleted hadiths are repeated. And the hadiths to be deleted here are already repeated. It is better for me to clarify this with an example: The hadith mentioned in his saying, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him: (War is a trick) narrated from Abu Hurairah in the previous project three times, at Al -Bukhari, and with Muslim, and with Ahmad - may God have mercy on them all - this is repeated by the convention, because it was reported from the companion three times. But this hadith itself (the war is a trick) narrated by other companions other than Abu Hurairah, they are: Jabir bin Abdullah, Ibn Abbas, Kaab bin Malik, and Aisha, may God be pleased with them, and their narration is not a repetition of the hadith of the difference of the companion. Jaber's hadith is not a repetition of the hadith of Ibn Abbas, Kaab or Aisha, but rather the hadith of each of them is a self -standing hadith. In this book, I will be satisfied with mentioning this hadith - and its ilk - once? Because the purpose is to mention the meaning or judgment once. (1/15) Anonymous, as well as the hadiths that converge in the content or match, for I am satisfied with mentioning one of them. This helps a lot in reducing the burden on the reader and minimizing the size of the book. This method came to eat, and the number of hadiths decreased from (28430) to become (3921), which is the number of hadiths of this book. 3 - Choosing the authentic hadiths: I worked on limiting the authentic and good hadiths. - That the weak hadith is circulating on the tongues, and not in the chapter of others, for I mention it to show its weakness. - That all hadiths of the chapter be weak, and the subject in the virtues of deeds, for I remember him taking the way of Imam Ahmad - may God have mercy on him - and in total, the weak hadiths that I saw were few were few when they reached (33), and (10) good hadiths said some of them with weakness. I did not mention a very talk",
    "Weakness. However, these hadiths will be clear distinct from others, by placing the judgment on them on a gray surface. (1/16) I am unknown and I love here to say: The number of hadiths of the two Sahihs mentioned in this book amounted to (2131) hadiths, that is: more than half of the hadiths of the book and its percentage is modified: 55 %, and this is enough to indicate the status of the correct in this book. 4 - Arranging the hadiths and explaining their sources: The hadiths of the two Sahihs came at the beginning of the chapters, then the hadiths of the Sunan were followed, then the hadiths of the Musnad and the rest of the books. At the end of each hadith, it was placed in the symbols and numbers, as the symbols indicate the book, and the numbers to indicate the number of the hadith in it. The hadiths of the two Sahihs were distinguished by mentioning their symbol at the beginning of the hadith: the letter (s) for the hadith if it is agreed upon and (Kh) for Bukhari, (M) for a Muslim and (p) for Bukhari if it is suspended. With the exception of the hadiths of the two Sahihs, it was placed at the end of the hadith, its degree of health and good. I was satisfied with the hadiths of the two Sahihs by mentioning their numbers, and I did not mention those who came out of the rest of the imams, as well as the hadiths of the Sunan. . . Note that most of them are what was stated in the \"Musnad\" in an abbreviation of the large number of footnotes and numbers, and whoever loves to fulfill this can refer to the origins of this book. (1/17) Anonymous 5 - The number of hadiths of this mosque and the implications of numbers: The number of hadiths of this mosque was previously (3921) hadiths, chosen from (114194) and recently. Some of them may be independent of this number, and it is surprising that the outcome of that large number. But this number is very close to the number of hadiths of the Imam Mosque \"Al -Tirmidhi\", which is (3956) recently. And Imam Al -Tirmidhi - and other owners of the Sunnah - but what they had deposited their books is a result of hundreds of thousands of hadiths that were in their hands, and there is no doubt that each of them chose - according to his diligence - to his book that meets the need of the Muslim jurist and every Muslim. Imam Abu Dawood said: I wrote about the Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, five hundred thousand hadiths, from which I elected what this book included - meaning the book “Sunan” - as well as the affairs of other books. And since our book was the result of the process of extrapolating, review and research of the fourteen books of books - which are in the hands - it is recommended to stop a little in front of the data recorded by this number: 1 - This work shows us the volume of repetition of the hadiths mentioned in the Sunnah books, and I did not imagine that that amount is reached, so the percentage of hadiths chosen to the original is 3, 4 % and this is a number that deserves to be a looked (1/18). 2 - 3 - The sum of the hadiths selected from the nine books in this mosque is (3691), and this means that they constitute 94 % of the original. In other words, the nine books have contained the entirety of the Sunnah, and what came in others, it will not add to the hadiths of the rulings in them, and if it adds some hadiths in the virtues, then it is what blocks it. 4 - The sum of the hadiths chosen from the remaining five books after the nine books, is (230) hadiths, knowing that the sum of their hadiths is (46741) and this confirms what the above said",
    "In the previous paragraph. 6 - Benefits and comments: I saw that it is advisable to draw attention to the benefits of some hadiths in a brief way, so I made this in the footnote preceded by the letter (T). (1/19) Anonymous the third topic: Notes that help to benefit from the book. These are some notes that help benefit from the book: First: The arrangement of the book’s research: The arrangement of this book came according to what was previously worked on in the previous books, which is an innovative order, which displays the material of the book through ten purposes, which are: the first destination: in the doctrine. The second destination: in science and its sources. The third destination: in acts of worship. The fourth destination: in the provisions of the family. The fifth destination: in the necessary needs. The sixth destination: in transactions. The seventh destination: in the Imamate and the affairs of government. The eighth destination: in chips, ethics and literature. The ninth destination: in history, biography and virtues. The tenth destination: in sedition. (1/20) Anonymous and falls under each intention \"books\" and under each book \"Chapters\" and in each chapter \"chapters\". Second: The graduation of hadiths and the ruling on them: I mentioned at the end of each hadith, the ruling on it is good, good, etc.. - “Sunan Al -Darmi”: His investigator, Mr. Hussein Salim Asad Al -Darani. - \"Musnad of Imam Ahmad\": His Eminence Sheikh Shuaib Al -Arnaout in the edition of Al -Risala Foundation. - \"Al -Muwatta\": His Eminence Sheikh Abdul Qadir Al -Arnaout - may God have mercy on him - in his investigation of the \"Mosque of Assets\". - “Al -Sunan Al -Kubra” by Al -Bayhaqi: His work was said: “And my custom in my books classified in the origins and branches is limited to the news of what is valid from them without what is not true, or a distinction between what is valid from them and what is not true.” This means that what the compiler did not comment on, it is correct or good, as the golden Imam commented on some of his hadiths. - Sahih Ibn Khuzaymah: Its investigator, Dr. Muhammad Mustafa Al -Adhami, judged the hadiths, and some of them participated in the Sheikh Al -Albani. - Sahih Ibn Hibban: His investigator, Sheikh Shuaib Al -Arnaout, graduated his hadiths. (1/21) Anonymous - Al -Mustadrak: Al -Hafiz Al -Dhahabi commented on some of his hadiths. - “The hadiths chosen” of Al -Meruksi: Its investigator, Dr. Abdul -Malik bin Dahish, graduated his hadiths. Third: The symbols: The Book Kh: Al -Bukhari M: Muslim Q: Agreed upon Kho: Al -Bukhari Douers d: Sunan Abi Dawood T: Sunan Al -Tirmidhi N: Sunan Al -Nasa’i: The hadiths p: to indicate that the hadith is from the narration of Abdullah bin Al -Imam Ahmad, or from his grandfather (1/22) is unknown and after: This is what God Almighty - with his help - is his work to collect this book, which I hope is sufficient for the purpose that he intended to, to make the need for every Muslim in what he must know about the Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him. We have seen how each of the fourteen books - which is the origin of this book - was a summary of the hundreds of thousands of hadiths that his author had, so he chose his book from it. In this author, I present a summary of the sum of these summaries, and is enough for the rulings",
